# Detecting AI-Generated Political Headlines  
**Final Exam – Machine Learning**  
**Author:** Arden Bentley  

## Project Overview  
This project explores the use of simple machine learning techniques to detect AI-generated political headlines and extract thematic content. It applies:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **K-Means Clustering** on sentence embeddings for classification and clustering  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to identify geopolitical themes

The dataset includes 1,000 political news headlines — 500 real and 500 generated by ChatGPT — each 10 words long. The task was framed within the context of combating generative AI in politically motivated disinformation campaigns.

## Objective  
To evaluate the effectiveness of lightweight ML approaches for:  
- **Detecting artificially generated political content**, and  
- **Extracting thematic signals from large-scale political text datasets**  

## Files  
- `SAMPLE_MLTI.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis  
- `headlines_data.csv` – Dataset of real and synthetic headlines  

##  Authorship  
All analysis and code were developed independently as part of a graduate-level final exam at Johns Hopkins SAIS. This project demonstrates practical machine learning skills and policy-relevant insights at the intersection of generative AI and information operations.
